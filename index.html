    <h1>THE LAST DINNER PARTY

    <p>Dear friends,
          <br><br> In a few days from now, I will be leaving the peace of the Hönggerberg upper
          atmosphere and adventure into the not-so-unknown streets of Paris. The future is left unwritten.
          Trust I will be back, and carry with me great tales and legends from that (not really) foreign land.

        Before my departure, it would be my greatest pleasure to share with thy a last evening. Details follow. </p>

        <br><br><br><br>
    <p> 28th of January 2025. <br> <br>
    6:30pm -ish (you know me). <br> <br>
    my house (if i sent you the link to this invite you most likely know it). <br> <br>
    vibe: chill apéro style, but definitely enough food to call it a dinner. <br> <br>
    dress code: wear something you never have the right occasion to wear!! <br> <br>
    feel free to bring something or not!</p>
